README file for ImAGERS - IMage Acquisition and Generalized Experiment Recipe Software

ImAGERS is being developed by Emma Cating-Subramanian and Jeremey Thurston, 2019

The purpose of this software is to make is easy for members of the Kapteyn-Murnane group to develop their own code to run experiments in a highly flexible way. We are doing this by writing gernalized classes to decsribe physical devices such as CCD cameras, delay stages, and sample stages which can be trivially interchanged; and developing a utility file containing many commonly-used functions.
